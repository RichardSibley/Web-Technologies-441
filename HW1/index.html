            <h2>My First Game Memory</h2>
            <p>One of my earliest video game memories was playing an arcade game called Pole Position. My family had a tradition of going to a local pizza place for Friday pizza nights, and they had the game there. The first time I played it, I was hooked. For almost a year, every Friday night, I spent countless quarters trying to perfect my skills and keep my name at the top of the high score list.

                I loved the game so much that one week, the restaurant owner came over to our table to tell me the machine was being replaced with a pinball game. I was devastated. But over time, I discovered new games that opened the door to countless digital adventures, sparking my passion for gaming</p>
