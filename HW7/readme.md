# Homework 7 Readme

Pretty Solid Week. I spent a lot of time working on formatting and making it pretty due to having a little extra time.

I found a vignetee effect on the weeble-webs (internet) and was able to incorporate it as an overlay.

I learned:
::before was a pseudo-element and was used to create an invisible layer over the viewmaster container.

radial-gradient: generated a circular gradient at center and expanding outward from 40% to 80%

Again AI was helpful in learning what worked and what didn't. I maintain my position that as a learning tool it's pretty solid. It understands coding well and explains it quite efficiently.
