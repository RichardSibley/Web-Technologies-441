# Homework 7 Readme

Okay so AI was all over the place on this one when I tried to get it to replicate. In order to get it to manage something cohesive I had to go back and forth editing prompts to get it to even come close to what was needed. The major things it struggled with:

1. It just made the images appear, despite me telling it to make it fade in, so i updated the prompt and it acted like I hadnt already put that in the parameters of the initial prompt.
2. It kept them on the screen and it became a cluttered mess, I had to "retell" it to fade them out.
3. After the changes above it just showed a black screen. I told it so, it checked and gave new code that adjusted the timing settings to make sure the fades weren't overlapping, they still did, just not as bad. It was a conflict in the sequence timing. It adjusted it multiple times with me telling it they weren't showing.
4. The text still wasn't showing, I found and changed myself that it was putting black text on a black background. WAT????

Those were the biggest. As always it explained things well after each change but it still struggled to wrangle all the paramaters together. It took so much back and forth trying to get fade in and out timing even close that I just set it myself, it was faster. XD
