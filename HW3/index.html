        <p id="story">You are the intrepid explorer Avery Stone and you have crash landed in an unfamiliar land! You take a moment to get your bearings and notice that you have 3 places you can go that lead to civilization. You landed at the edge of a Darkened Forest that is seperated from Open Plains by a quick running river. You can cut through the Darkened Forest, Build a Raft to face the river, or ford the river to cross the Open Plains. Make a choice below!</p>
